### NYC Taxi Data Analysis and Trip Duration Prediction


#### Abstract
This project delves into forecasting journey times using NYC Yellow Taxi Ride Data for January 2016 sourced from NYC.gov. The study utilizes preprocessing techniques including winsorization and dummy encoding, and employs machine learning models like XGBoost Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Multiple Linear Regression for prediction. Results indicate XGBoost Regressor outperformed other models, showcasing the efficacy of ensemble models in trip duration forecasting.

#### Dataset
The dataset comprises Yellow Taxi Trip Record Data for January 2016, featuring various attributes including pickup/dropoff datetime, passenger count, trip distance, and fare details. Preprocessing steps involved handling duplicates, null values, and converting datetime columns.

#### Data Preparation and Cleaning
Elimination of Duplicates, Handling Null Values, Date Conversion, Feature Deletion, and Outlier Analysis were crucial steps in preparing the dataset for analysis.

#### Research Questions
Can NYC taxi ride durations be accurately predicted based on factors like time, distance, and day of the week? The study also aims to explore differences between actual and predicted trip durations.

#### Methods
Data analysis involved descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand data distributions. Machine learning models were employed, evaluated using R2 and RMSE metrics.

#### Findings
Insights revealed distinct travel patterns by hour, weekday, and month. Tuesdays exhibited longer trips, while Fridays witnessed peak demand, especially during evening rush hours.

#### Conclusions
Random Forest Regressor emerged as the most effective model for trip duration prediction. Discrepancies between actual and predicted durations were analyzed, informing future model adjustments.

#### Limitations
Limitations include the focus on January 2016 data and potential biases from data quality variations. Future studies could encompass broader temporal scopes and incorporate external factors like weather.

#### Future Works
Future work may include expanding temporal scope, advanced feature selection techniques, time series analysis, hyperparameter tuning, and incorporating external elements like weather data to enhance prediction realism and business impact.
